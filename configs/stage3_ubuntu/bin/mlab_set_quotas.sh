# A simple script to facilitate setting XFS project quotas based on a
# configuration file.
#
# NOTE: Project IDs in the configuration file should never be removed or
# reused. If you want to disable quotas for a particular project/directory
# simply set the quota value to 0, which will effectively remove any quota,
# though accounting will still be happening.  In other words, only add new
# lines to the configuration file, don't remove them. You can recover from
# having removed something by simply rebooting the platform node, which will
# reformat the data mount, wiping out all accounting data with it.  From there
# you can start fresh.
#
# For the reasoning on why you see "sleep 0.1" before echo commands see:
# https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/2913
