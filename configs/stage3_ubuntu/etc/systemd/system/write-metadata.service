[Unit]
Description=Writes metadata to a known location
Before=setup-after-boot.service

# generate-eth0-config.service sets the hostname of the machine to the expected
# M-Lab DNS name for the machine. Since this write-metadata unit writes the
# hostname value to the metadata directory, then be sure this unit runs later,
# otherwise we get some randomish looking string for the hostname. Additionally,
# wait until the eth0 interface exists and the machine network is online.
