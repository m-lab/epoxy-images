This directory and its contents are here as a way to temporarily shoehorn
Container Linux Update Operator (CLUO) into an Ubuntu environment. This
directory gets mounted into the filesystem of the update-agent pods, as it
expects to find these files and will not work without them.

The os-release file was sourced from an existing CoreOS platform node at the
time of this writing, and the same for the update.conf file, with the
exception that I updated the SERVER variable to point to a Flatcar Linux
update server, since eventually Redhat will shut down the CoreOS update
servers.
