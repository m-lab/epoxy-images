# TODO: Be sure that BIOS versions are consistent across the platform.
#
# Because we have inconsistent BIOS versions on platform nodes, not every BIOS
# has all the same options. Some BIOSs appear to have an option BootOptionRom
# that must be enabled in order to set the NIC as a boot device. Other BIOSs
# seem to not have this option, but instead have the option LegacyBootProto,
# which likewise must be set to "PXE" (default seems to be "None") in order to
# set the NIC as the first boot device. If either one of these options doesn't
# exist in the BIOS, then the command should benignly fail, but this makes sure
# that at least one of them, maybe both, get set.
# 
# First make sure that the option exists and that the value isn't what we want
# already. If it does exist and isn't set correctly then, try MAX_RETRIES to set
# it to what we want. We attempt this multiple times due to observed flakiness
# in the ability of any given command to succeed any given time.

# Track how many changes to the BIOS were actually made, because if we don't
# make any changes and then try schedule a job in the jobqueue, we will get an
# error.
